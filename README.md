# RSA_File-encryption-tool
A file encryption tool using the RSA algorithm with a key length of 2048 bits
For the tool to work correctly, you need to install the OpenSSL library, which contains the BUGNUM class for working with several numbers.
P.S. The implementation does not involve selecting a file during operation (only a change in the code), if necessary, implement.
